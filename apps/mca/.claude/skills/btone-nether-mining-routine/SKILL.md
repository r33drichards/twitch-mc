description: Use when an agent driving a btone-mod-c Minecraft Bot is asked to mine resources in the Nether (blackstone, basalt, netherrack, ancient_debris, etc.) — the proven mine→store→resupply loop with survival settings, baritone gotchas, and death recovery.
---

# Nether mining routine for the btone Bot

## The loop

```
1. MINE          (in the Nether, until inventory near full)
2. STORE         (back to overworld warehouse, deposit haul)
3. RESUPPLY      (only if needed — pickaxe durability low, food < 16, armor missing)
4. goto 1
```

This is the entire steady-state. Each step expands below.

## One-time setup (run before the first iteration)

```bash
# Standard preamble — every agent shell needs this
CFG="$HOME/btone-mc-work/config/btone-bridge.json"
PORT=$(jq -r .port "$CFG")
TOKEN=$(jq -r .token "$CFG")
BASE="http://127.0.0.1:$PORT"
H=(-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json")
rpc() { curl -s -X POST "$BASE/rpc" "${H[@]}" -d "$1"; }
```

Make sure baritone is configured for safe mining and Meteor survival modules
are on. Re-run after every restart — Meteor settings persist but Baritone's
`allowBreak` resets:

```bash
rpc '{"method":"baritone.command","params":{"text":"set allowBreak true"}}'
# Always allow parkour. Earlier we kept it off thinking it'd cause fall
# deaths; turned out the bigger risk is bot getting STUCK on tiny ledges
# and 1-block hops it refuses to clear. With no-fall enabled, the parkour
# fall risk is moot.
rpc '{"method":"baritone.command","params":{"text":"set allowParkour true"}}'
# allowPlace + allowParkourPlace let baritone pillar-up out of holes by
# placing a block under itself. See the btone-getting-unstuck skill.

rpc '{"method":"baritone.command","params":{"text":"set mobAvoidanceRadius 16"}}'

# data (World save took 2200ms+) and the server kicks the bot for being

# blocksToAvoidBreaking adds friction; smaller mineScanDroppedItems
# reduces the cost of every iteration.
rpc '{"method":"baritone.command","params":{"text":"set mineGoalUpdateInterval 8000"}}'
rpc '{"method":"baritone.command","params":{"text":"set blockReachDistance 4.0"}}'

### Why each Meteor module — and how to find new ones

| Module | What it does for the bot |
|---|---|
| `auto-eat` | Eats food from hotbar/offhand when food bar drops. Required for unattended runs. **Blacklist tweaked in this project to allow `rotten_flesh`** — bot can survive on mob-drop food when normal supplies run out. Set via `meteor.module.setting_set name=auto-eat setting=blacklist value=...` if it gets reset. |
| `auto-armor` | Pulls armor pieces from main inventory into slots 36-39. The reason "grab any armor and let auto-armor equip it" works. |
| `auto-tool` | Switches to the best hotbar tool for whatever block the bot is breaking. Mines blackstone with the diamond pickaxe even if a stone pickaxe is selected. |
| `auto-weapon` | Same as auto-tool but for hostile mobs. Combined with kill-aura, the bot fights back with the best sword in hotbar. |
| `auto-replenish` | When a hotbar stack empties or a hotbar tool breaks, pulls another of the same item id from main inventory into that slot. **Lets the bot keep mining even when its first pickaxe shatters** — as long as a spare is anywhere in main inventory. |
| `kill-aura` | Auto-attacks hostile mobs in range. Pairs with auto-weapon. |
| `safe-walk` | Sneaks at edges. **Footgun in the nether** — freezes the bot on narrow platforms. Leave OFF; prefer `no-fall` instead. |
| `no-fall` | Negates fall damage entirely (sends a 0.0 velocity packet right before landing). The single biggest win for nether mining — magma-cube knockback off a y=96 ledge becomes a non-event. |
| `auto-totem` | Auto-equips a Totem of Undying in the offhand slot. If the bot has even one totem, fatal damage triggers it for a free respawn-on-the-spot. Stack a few in inventory. |
| `auto-respawn` | Automates the respawn click after death — saves the agent from having to call `player.respawn` manually. |
| `auto-mend` | If the bot is holding/wearing Mending tools/armor, exp orbs auto-repair them. Compounds well with auto-tool. |
| `anti-hunger` | Cuts hunger drain (avoids sprinting drain mostly). Combined with auto-eat, lets the bot stay topped up on much less food. |
| `run-away-from-danger` | **Custom mod-c module** (Combat category in Meteor's GUI). Triggers on either a hostile mob entering `range` blocks OR a sudden HP drop. Stops Baritone and pathfinds away from the threat. All settings configurable via the GUI or `meteor.module.setting_*` RPCs. |

When the bot needs a new background behavior, scan `meteor.modules.list`
for it before writing custom RPC logic:

```bash
rpc '{"method":"meteor.modules.list"}' | jq -r '.result.modules[]' | grep -i KEYWORD
```

Examples of useful searches: `tool`, `hotbar`, `replenish`, `inv`, `armor`,
`eat`, `swap`, `aura`. If a module exists, prefer enabling it over scripting
the same behavior with `container.click` / `player.inventory` polling — the
module runs every tick on the client, the script polls every few seconds.

## IMPORTANT: use `baritone.command`, not `baritone.mine`

The `baritone.mine` RPC deadlocks the Minecraft client thread on this
server (confirmed 2026-04-23). Once it fires, subsequent RPC calls
— including `player.state`, `baritone.stop`, anything — return
`TimeoutException:null` and MC has to be killed and restarted.

Use `baritone.command` with a `text` of `"mine <block_id> [<block_id>...]"`
instead. `baritone.command` runs on a dedicated worker thread
(`COMMAND_EXEC`) via `getCommandManager().execute(text)` and skips the
deadlock path entirely. Every code block in this skill that fires
mining does so through `baritone.command` for that reason.

## Step 1: MINE

Walk to the nearest portal, transit, mine until one of the two return
triggers fires.

### Return-to-portal triggers (THE TWO)

The MINE phase ends when — and only when — one of these two events fires:

1. **`PICKAXE_CRITICAL picks=1`** — pickaxe count drops to 1. One more
   break and the bot is punching basalt with fists.
2. **`INV_FULL free≤2`** — inventory has 2 or fewer free slots. Further
   mined blocks despawn on the ground.

Both are delivered as `<task-notification>` events from the persistent
Monitors armed in the Event Monitors section. On either event, the agent
(or this poll loop) must:

```
baritone.stop → baritone.goto nether_portal → traverse → STORE → RESUPPLY
```

HP-based triggers (death, low-HP flee cluster) are handled by the
separate death/flee monitors and route through the Death Recovery path,
not through STORE.

```bash
# 1a. Walk to portal (works in either dim — gets the dim-local portal)

# productive mining spot in a state file (cleared whenever the bot dies)
# and pre-walk there. This avoids re-entering known-deadly areas on every

  fi

  sleep 10
done
```

The state file lives at `~/btone-mc-work/.last-safe-mining-spot.json` (a
single `{x, y, z}` object). The contract:
- **Written** while `baritone.mine` is making progress AND the bot's y-coord
  is above the project's documented fall-death floor.
- **Read** at the start of the next MINE cycle to pre-walk before firing
  `baritone.mine`.
- **Deleted** on death so a deadly spot doesn't get re-tried.

### Exhaustion + exploration

When the MINE poll's `USED` count stops growing for ~3 min (~18 polls)
while baritone is still active, the local area is exhausted. Don't keep
spinning — the bot is just walking in circles around already-mined
basalt. Two-step recovery:

```bash
# 1. Get the bot up high if it's deep down — open-air pillar so the
#    relocation path isn't blocked by floors of basalt.
PY=$(rpc '{"method":"player.state"}' | jq -r '.result.blockPos.y')
if [ "$PY" -lt 60 ] 2>/dev/null; then
  rpc '{"method":"player.pillar_up","params":{"block":"minecraft:basalt","target_y":90,"max_ticks":600}}'
fi

# 2. Walk 100+ blocks in a fixed direction (NW here — pick whichever
#    is opposite the documented death zone for your project). Then
#    re-fire baritone.mine and overwrite the spot file with the new
#    productive coords.
rpc '{"method":"baritone.command","params":{"text":"goto -100 95 50"}}'
# wait for arrival, then:
P=$(rpc '{"method":"player.state"}' | jq -c '.result.blockPos')
echo "$P" > "$SPOT_FILE"
rpc '{"method":"baritone.command","params":{"text":"mine minecraft:blackstone minecraft:basalt"}}'
```

Saving the new spot to the file is the load-bearing step: the next cycle
will pre-walk to it directly from the portal instead of starting in the
exhausted region. Over many cycles this naturally moves the bot's
working area outward as nearby reserves deplete.

## Step 2: STORE

Back to overworld, deposit at warehouse 2 (see `coords.md` for the project's
specific coords).

```bash
# 2a. Stop mining, walk to portal. KNOW THE PORTAL COORDS in BOTH dims
# (see coords.md "Nether portal pair") — get_to_block silently no-ops if no
# portal block is in baritone's scan range, which is easy to hit when the
# bot has wandered 100+ blocks from spawn. Use baritone.goto with explicit
# coords as a fallback so the bot can ALWAYS find its way home.
NETHER_PORTAL_X=61; NETHER_PORTAL_Y=99; NETHER_PORTAL_Z=110   # ← from coords.md (nether side)
OVERWORLD_PORTAL_X=480; OVERWORLD_PORTAL_Y=70; OVERWORLD_PORTAL_Z=858

rpc '{"method":"baritone.stop"}'
DIM=$(rpc '{"method":"player.state"}' | jq -r '.result.dim')
if [ "$DIM" = "minecraft:the_nether" ]; then
  PORTAL_GOAL="$NETHER_PORTAL_X,$NETHER_PORTAL_Y,$NETHER_PORTAL_Z"
else
  PORTAL_GOAL="$OVERWORLD_PORTAL_X,$OVERWORLD_PORTAL_Y,$OVERWORLD_PORTAL_Z"
fi
PX=$(echo "$PORTAL_GOAL" | cut -d, -f1)
PY=$(echo "$PORTAL_GOAL" | cut -d, -f2)
PZ=$(echo "$PORTAL_GOAL" | cut -d, -f3)
# Try the smart scan first (faster when in range), explicit-coord fallback
# if the bot is too far for the scanner.
rpc '{"method":"baritone.get_to_block","params":{"blockId":"minecraft:nether_portal"}}' >/dev/null
sleep 6
ACT=$(rpc '{"method":"baritone.status"}' | jq -r '.result.active')
if [ "$ACT" = "false" ]; then
  echo "get_to_block didn't engage; falling back to explicit goto ($PX, $PY, $PZ)"
  rpc "{\"method\":\"baritone.goto\",\"params\":{\"x\":$PX,\"y\":$PY,\"z\":$PZ}}"
fi
# wait for dim flip

# 2b. Walk to warehouse 2 (project-specific coords from coords.md)
WH_X=478; WH_Y=71; WH_Z=834   # ← from coords.md
rpc "{\"method\":\"baritone.goto\",\"params\":{\"x\":$WH_X,\"y\":$WH_Y,\"z\":$WH_Z}}"
# wait for arrival

# 2c. Find chests/barrels in radius 8 with empty space, deposit each material stack
CHESTS=$(rpc '{"method":"world.blocks_around","params":{"radius":8}}' | jq -c '.result.blocks | map(select(.id | test("chest|barrel")))')
N=$(echo "$CHESTS" | jq 'length')
for i in $(seq 0 $((N-1))); do
  # Bail if all materials gone
  LEFT=$(rpc '{"method":"player.inventory"}' | jq -r '[.result.main[] | select(.id == "minecraft:basalt" or .id == "minecraft:blackstone")] | length')
  [ "$LEFT" = "0" ] && break

  CX=$(echo "$CHESTS" | jq -r ".[$i].x"); CY=$(echo "$CHESTS" | jq -r ".[$i].y"); CZ=$(echo "$CHESTS" | jq -r ".[$i].z")
  rpc "{\"method\":\"container.open\",\"params\":{\"x\":$CX,\"y\":$CY,\"z\":$CZ}}" >/dev/null
  sleep 1.2
  STATE=$(rpc '{"method":"container.state"}')
  NSLOT=$(echo "$STATE" | jq -r '.result.slots // [] | length')
  [ "$NSLOT" = "0" ] || [ "$NSLOT" = "null" ] && { rpc '{"method":"container.close"}' >/dev/null; continue; }
  # NSLOT only counts NON-EMPTY slots — useless for sizing. Use max slot id.
  MAX=$(echo "$STATE" | jq -r '[.result.slots[]?.slot] | max // 0')
  CHEST_SIZE=$([ "$MAX" -ge 54 ] && echo 54 || echo 27)
  # QUICK_MOVE basalt + blackstone from player slots (>= CHEST_SIZE) into chest
  for slot in $(echo "$STATE" | jq -r ".result.slots[]? | select(.slot >= $CHEST_SIZE and (.id == \"minecraft:basalt\" or .id == \"minecraft:blackstone\")) | .slot"); do
    rpc "{\"method\":\"container.click\",\"params\":{\"slot\":$slot,\"button\":0,\"mode\":\"QUICK_MOVE\"}}" >/dev/null
    sleep 0.15
  done
  rpc '{"method":"container.close"}' >/dev/null
  sleep 0.3
done
```

If a chest fills mid-deposit, the QUICK_MOVE silently no-ops on full chest
slots. The `for $i` loop iterates to the next chest.

## Step 3: RESUPPLY (only if needed)

### 3.0. CRAFT-FIRST CHECK (before walking to any chest)

Scan the bot's inventory for craft-from-materials options BEFORE pathing
to a chest. The bot frequently carries enough iron_block + log to make
several iron pickaxes — walking back to the chest wall is wasted effort
when the materials are already in hand. Especially valuable mid-nether
when the bot is out of picks but stuck deep below the portal:
crafting in-place avoids the long climb back AND the chest scan.

```bash
INV=$(rpc '{"method":"player.inventory"}' | jq -c '.result.main')
PICKS=$(echo "$INV" | jq '[.[] | select(.id | test("pickaxe"))] | length')
INGOTS=$(echo "$INV" | jq '[.[] | select(.id == "minecraft:iron_ingot") | .count] | add // 0')
BLOCKS=$(echo "$INV" | jq '[.[] | select(.id == "minecraft:iron_block") | .count] | add // 0')
STICKS=$(echo "$INV" | jq '[.[] | select(.id == "minecraft:stick") | .count] | add // 0')
PLANKS=$(echo "$INV" | jq '[.[] | select(.id | test("planks")) | .count] | add // 0')
LOGS=$(echo "$INV" | jq '[.[] | select(.id | test("_log")) | .count] | add // 0')

# Iron-pickaxe budget: 3 ingots + 2 sticks per pick
# Available ingots = INGOTS + BLOCKS*9 ; Sticks-equiv = STICKS + PLANKS*2 + LOGS*8
TOTAL_INGOTS=$((INGOTS + BLOCKS * 9))
TOTAL_STICKS=$((STICKS + PLANKS * 2 + LOGS * 8))
PICKS_FROM_INV=$(( TOTAL_INGOTS / 3 < TOTAL_STICKS / 2 ? TOTAL_INGOTS / 3 : TOTAL_STICKS / 2 ))

if [ "$PICKS" -lt 3 ] && [ "$PICKS_FROM_INV" -ge 2 ]; then
  echo "CRAFT-FIRST: have materials for $PICKS_FROM_INV picks, skipping chest trip"
  # If no crafting_table accessible, craft one in player 2x2 inv first:
  #   container.open_inventory → 4 planks into slots 1-4 → QUICK_MOVE slot 0
  # Then world.place_block to drop the table somewhere reachable, container.open it,
  # and run the standard craft sequence (block→ingot, log→planks, planks→sticks,
  # then iron_pickaxe via 3-ingot top + 2-stick column).
fi
```

The crafting-table recipe (4 planks in 2x2) FITS inside the player's own
inventory crafting grid — `container.open_inventory` exposes it. So even
mid-nether with no chest, the bot can make a portable workbench from
existing planks. Verified 2026-04-19 at (64, 16, 94) — bot was stuck deep
underground with 0 picks but had 12 planks; opened inv, crafted table,
placed it, crafted iron_pickaxes from 14 iron_block + 60 oak_log it had
collected during that mining cycle. No long climb-out + warehouse round
trip needed.

Only fall through to the chest stops below if `PICKS_FROM_INV < 2` AND
the bot is missing armor/sword/food too.

### Resupply triggers (after the craft-first check)

Check three things:

```bash
# Pickaxe durability
PICK_COUNT=$(rpc '{"method":"player.inventory"}' | jq -r '[.result.main[] | select(.id | test("pickaxe"))] | length')
# (Note: btone-mod-c doesn't currently expose item durability via RPC.
#  Fall back to: count of pickaxes. Diamond pickaxe lasts ~1500 blocks.
#  As a heuristic, swap when bot has only 1 left and you've mined ~1k blocks
#  since last swap. The user will tell you "your pickaxe durability is low".)

# Food
FOOD_COUNT=$(rpc '{"method":"player.inventory"}' | jq -r '[.result.main[] | select(.id | test("bread|cooked_|porkchop|apple|carrot")) | .count] | add // 0')

# Armor pieces equipped (slots 36-39)
ARMOR_COUNT=$(rpc '{"method":"player.inventory"}' | jq -r '[.result.main[] | select(.slot >= 36 and .slot <= 39)] | length')

echo "pickaxes=$PICK_COUNT food=$FOOD_COUNT armor=$ARMOR_COUNT"
```

Resupply triggers:
- `pickaxes < 3` (target: 1 in hand + 2 spares so a single break doesn't end the run) → grab from chest wall
- `pickaxes == 0` mid-mine — the MINE poll loop breaks on this; don't try to keep mining bare-handed
- `food < 16` → restock from primary chest first, then Warehouse 1 (`454-463, 71-76, 825-836`) which has lots of `rotten_flesh` that the auto-eat blacklist now accepts
- `armor < 4` → grab from chest wall (auto-armor equips)
- **`sword == 0` → MANDATORY before any nether re-entry.** Magma cubes do massive knockback and per-hit damage; without a sword in hotbar, kill-aura's bare-fist strikes can't out-damage the cube before it pushes the bot off a ledge. Confirmed 2026-04-19: bot died "doomed to fall by Magma Cube" at (73, 57, 141) on a sword-less RESUPPLY cycle. The loot-wall iron-pickaxe chest does NOT carry swords reliably — fall back to the primary chest at `(437, 68, 847)` which holds iron_sword stacks per `coords.md`.
- **`planks < 11` → MANDATORY for any nether trip.** Without ≥11 planks, the "Your Items Are Safe" mod can't absorb a death and the bot loses everything (3 picks + full armor + food = ~5 min of crafting + 2 transits to replace). Craft from birch_log if no chest carries planks: `birch_log → 4 planks` is one shapeless craft per log, so 3 logs = 12 planks. Death insurance worked at the same (73, 57, 141) death — items recovered intact at coords with `Your items are safe` chat line.

### 3a. Pickaxe / armor / food — primary chest first, loot wall as fallback

Two stops, in order: the **primary gear+food chest** (project-specific
location, see `coords.md` — typically near the bot's warehouse) covers
food and most armor, and the **loot wall** is the fallback for what the
primary doesn't have (currently: diamond_pickaxe, full diamond armor set).

### 3b. Food — from food barrels OR by baking bread

**From barrels** (project-specific coords; see `coords.md`):

```bash
rpc '{"method":"baritone.goto","params":{"x":448,"y":71,"z":855}}'
# wait, then for each food barrel:
rpc '{"method":"container.open","params":{"x":449,"y":71,"z":855}}'
sleep 1
STATE=$(rpc '{"method":"container.state"}')
CHEST_SIZE=$([ "$(echo $STATE | jq '.result.slots | length')" -gt 70 ] && echo 54 || echo 27)
# Take everything food-ish from the chest portion only
TAKEN=0
for slot in $(echo "$STATE" | jq -r ".result.slots[]? | select(.slot < $CHEST_SIZE and (.id | test(\"bread|apple|cooked_|baked_potato|carrot|melon|beef|porkchop|chicken|mutton|salmon|cod|stew|gapple\"))) | .slot"); do
  rpc "{\"method\":\"container.click\",\"params\":{\"slot\":$slot,\"button\":0,\"mode\":\"QUICK_MOVE\"}}" >/dev/null
  sleep 0.15
  TAKEN=$((TAKEN+1))
  [ $TAKEN -ge 5 ] && break  # don't fill inventory with food
done
rpc '{"method":"container.close"}'
```

**By baking bread from hay** (when no food cache nearby): 16 hay → 9×16=144
wheat → 48 bread. Process:
1. `baritone.mine blocks=["minecraft:hay_block"] quantity=16` — needs
   `allowBreak=true` AND must be outside spawn protection.
2. Walk to a `crafting_table` block.
3. `container.open` it. Slot map: 0=output, 1-9=grid, 10-36=player main,
   37-45=hotbar.
4. `QUICK_MOVE` hay from your hotbar slot into the grid (single hay in any
   grid slot = 9 wheat output).
5. `QUICK_MOVE` slot 0 (output) repeatedly until grid empties.
6. For bread: `PICKUP` a wheat stack (cursor holds it), then right-click
   slots 1, 2, 3 (`button:1`) to place 1 wheat in each, `QUICK_MOVE` slot 0
   for 1 bread, repeat ~21 times per 64-wheat-cursor. Drop cursor remainder
   back in inventory by clicking original slot.

(Don't bake more than ~30 bread per round trip — slot pressure.)

## Hotbar discipline (do this every time you grab a tool)

Tools quick-moved from a chest land in the first free inventory slot — usually
a main-inventory slot (9-35), NOT the hotbar (0-8). The bot's auto-tool /
auto-weapon Meteor modules only swap from the *hotbar*, so a pickaxe sitting
in slot 35 is invisible to them. Symptom: `baritone.mine` reports `started`
but the bot tries to punch blackstone with bare fists.

**`auto-replenish` does the right thing for breakage** — when a hotbar
diamond_pickaxe shatters, auto-replenish finds another diamond_pickaxe in
main inventory and pulls it into the now-empty hotbar slot. Auto-tool then
selects it. So the hotbar discipline below only matters for the FIRST tool
of each kind — once any pickaxe is in slot N, future spares replenish there
automatically.

After every chest visit, pull tools into the hotbar via SWAP. SWAP requires
a container open — easiest is to open the chest you just grabbed from before
closing it, OR open any nearby chest. `button` is the *destination hotbar
slot* (0-8), `slot` is the *source inventory slot*.

```bash
# Reserve hotbar slot 6 for the spare/working pickaxe.
rpc '{"method":"container.open","params":{"x":568,"y":66,"z":910}}' >/dev/null
sleep 0.5
INV=$(rpc '{"method":"player.inventory"}' | jq -c '.result.main')
TOOL_SLOT=$(echo "$INV" | jq -r '[.[] | select(.id | test("pickaxe")) | select(.slot >= 9 and .slot <= 35)][0].slot // empty')
if [ -n "$TOOL_SLOT" ]; then
  # Container-GUI slot for player main inventory = (inv_slot - 9) + chest_size
  CHEST_SIZE=$(rpc '{"method":"container.state"}' | jq -r '[.result.slots[]? | select(.slot < 54)] | length')
  GUI_SLOT=$(( TOOL_SLOT - 9 + CHEST_SIZE ))
  rpc "{\"method\":\"container.click\",\"params\":{\"slot\":$GUI_SLOT,\"button\":6,\"mode\":\"SWAP\"}}" >/dev/null
fi
rpc '{"method":"container.close"}' >/dev/null
```

Suggested hotbar layout the bot keeps:
- 0: sword (kill-aura uses whatever's selected, but auto-weapon swaps anyway)
- 1: food
- 2-5: free for blocks the bot collects (basalt, blackstone for bridging)
- 6: pickaxe (primary)
- 7: spare pickaxe / axe
- 8: free

Re-check after every resupply: any tool found at `slot >= 9` should be
swapped into its hotbar reservation.

## Combat interrupt — keep baritone from walking the bot to its death

`kill-aura` swings at hostile mobs in range, but Baritone keeps pathing
forward by default. Two layers of defense, in priority order:

**1. Pathfinding avoidance (preventive, set in one-time setup):**
`mobAvoidanceCoefficient=4.0` and `mobAvoidanceRadius=16` make Baritone
penalize squares near hostile mobs heavily, so it routes around them when
possible. This handles the common case (lone zombie on the path) without
any extra logic.

**2. HP-drop watcher (reactive, run alongside the MINE poll):**
For situations where avoidance isn't enough — surrounded, ambushed in a
narrow tunnel, blaze fire from above — a tiny watcher pauses Baritone
when the bot takes damage and resumes the original goal once kill-aura
clears the area:

```bash
# Run this in the background while baritone.mine is going.
# Pauses mining if HP drops by ≥1 heart between samples; resumes after 5s.
LAST_HP=20
LAST_BLOCKS='["minecraft:blackstone","minecraft:basalt"]'  # whatever you fired
while true; do
  HP=$(rpc '{"method":"player.state"}' | jq -r '.result.health // 0')
  ACTIVE=$(rpc '{"method":"baritone.status"}' | jq -r '.result.active')
  # bash can't do floats — multiply by 100 and use integer compare
  HP_X100=$(awk "BEGIN{print int($HP * 100)}")
  LAST_X100=$(awk "BEGIN{print int($LAST_HP * 100)}")
  DROP=$(( LAST_X100 - HP_X100 ))
  if [ "$DROP" -gt 200 ] && [ "$ACTIVE" = "true" ]; then
    echo "$(date +%H:%M:%S) HP $LAST_HP→$HP, pausing baritone for combat"
    rpc '{"method":"baritone.stop"}' >/dev/null
    sleep 5
    echo "$(date +%H:%M:%S) resuming mine"
    rpc "{\"method\":\"baritone.mine\",\"params\":{\"blocks\":$LAST_BLOCKS,\"quantity\":-1}}" >/dev/null
  fi
  LAST_HP=$HP
  [ "$HP" = "0" ] && break
  sleep 2
done
```

The `&` it (background) right after firing `baritone.mine`, then run the
inventory poll in the foreground. When inventory poll exits (full / dead),
kill the watcher: `kill %1`.

**Why not have kill-aura itself pause baritone?** Meteor's kill-aura runs
every client tick and doesn't know about Baritone's process queue. There's
no cross-module hook. The HP-drop watcher is the loose-coupled equivalent.

Future improvement: a `world.entities_around` RPC + a built-in
`pause-baritone-on-hostile-in-radius` mode in mod-c — would let us drop
the bash-side watcher entirely.

## Step 4: goto 1

After resupply (or skip if no resupply needed), back to MINE.

## Death recovery

Mining trips end in death often. When `player.state.health == 0.0`:

```bash
rpc '{"method":"player.respawn"}'
sleep 3
# Read death coords from chat (most recent "Death Coordinates" line)
DEATH=$(rpc '{"method":"chat.recent","params":{"n":15}}' | jq -r '.result.messages[]?' | grep -E "Death Coordinates" | tail -1)
echo "$DEATH"
# Walk to those coords if within 5 minutes (items haven't despawned)
# Walking through them auto-picks them up.

# Then re-run resupply (Step 3) to refill missing gear.
```

The bot's spawn point is sticky to the spawn-area chest fortress; even if
death was in the Nether, respawn returns to overworld spawn. After Nether
death you typically need to: respawn → walk to overworld portal → walk to
Nether portal → traverse → walk to death coords. Items expire 5 min after
drop.

If items are unrecoverable, jump straight back to RESUPPLY.

## Common failure modes (don't waste cycles)

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `baritone.mine` returns `started:true` but inventory count never increases | `allowBreak=false` | `set allowBreak true` via `baritone.command` |
| Bot stops mining after a few seconds | hit a wall it won't break (in `blocksToAvoidBreaking`) or ran out of target blocks in scan range | move bot 20 blocks in some direction, re-fire mine |
| `world.mine_block` returns `started:true` but block stays | one-shot attackBlock = single tick of mining damage; survival mining needs continuous breaking | use `baritone.mine` instead |
| `container.open` returns success but `container.state` shows null/empty slots | bot too far (>~5 blocks) — open didn't actually fire server-side | `baritone.goto` adjacent, retry |
| Bot drowns at low Y in the overworld between portal and warehouse | walking through kelp forests near spawn | warehouse walk should pin Y >= 70; or set baritone `allowSwim true` and accept slower pathing |
| Bot dies in nether to "doomed to fall by Magma Cube" repeatedly at the same ledge | mob knockback at y≥80 → 30+ block fall = lethal. mobAvoidance only helps for ROUTING; once the cube is adjacent, baritone has no reaction. | Enable Meteor `safe-walk` (sneaks at edges so knockback can't push the bot off). If the same area kills repeatedly, send the bot 50+ blocks in a different direction with `baritone.goto` before firing the next `baritone.mine`. |
| Quick-move from chest leaves items in chest GUI but inventory empty | Race condition: `container.state` read before GUI populated. Sleep ≥1s after `container.open` before reading state. |
| First `container.click` after `container.open` silently no-ops (subsequent clicks work) | GUI sync with server not complete at the moment of first interaction; the 0.15-0.2s inter-click sleep is too short to absorb the initial populate | Sleep ≥1.3s after `container.open` before the FIRST click. Between clicks, 0.4-0.6s is reliable; 0.15s is a 5% no-op risk. Symptom: open → 5× QUICK_MOVE → close → inventory unchanged. Confirmed 2026-04-19 against the loot wall. |
| After nether transit, `baritone.mine` reports `started:true count:N async:true` but `baritone.status.active` stays false and bot never moves | Baritone internal goal queue didn't fully reset across dim transition — it holds a stale goal from before the portal that new commands don't displace | `baritone.stop` → re-send `allowBreak/allowParkour/allowPlace/allowSprint` config → re-fire `baritone.mine`. The config-replay is the load-bearing step; stop alone wasn't enough. Confirmed 2026-04-19 at (64,93,106) in nether, ~2 min after overworld→nether transit. **NOT just a post-transit thing:** same symptom also hit at (36,32,120) mid-run after 5+ min of continuous mining with no dim flips. Treat the reset cadence as "apply on EVERY `baritone.mine` re-fire", not "apply once after transit". |
| Only stone pickaxes available at the loot wall (no diamond) | Loot wall stock drains over time; `coords.md` snapshot may be stale | **Craft iron pickaxes instead.** Warehouse 1 center-row chests at **`(459-460, 72-74, 831)`** hold ~3967 iron_block + 1337 birch_log (see `coords.md` "Iron + wood stash"). Walk to warehouse, grab iron_block + birch_log, walk to the `crafting_table` at `(462, 70, 840)`, craft planks → sticks → iron_pickaxe (3 iron + 2 sticks each), deposit spares at the loot wall chests so future RESUPPLY finds them. Iron durability = 251 (nearly 2× stone). Still usable: the loot wall has stone_pickaxe as emergency fallback (5 × 131 = 655 blocks per resupply trip). |
| Bot stuck in a small air pocket in the nether (can't `baritone.goto`, can't `baritone.mine`, can't `player.pillar_up`) | Basalt fills most directions around the bot; Baritone refuses to break through with `allowBreak=true` when surrounded by lava/magma neighbors (safety heuristics win). `pillar_up` fails when basalt isn't in the *selected* hotbar slot, OR when ceiling above (y+2) is solid. `world.mine_block` only delivers 1 tick of attack damage per call. | **NEVER ask the user to free the bot manually.** The skill must self-rescue via RPCs. Try in order: (1) Use `container.open_inventory` + SWAP to put basalt in the *selected* hotbar slot (default 0) and pickaxe into another slot — `pillar_up` requires basalt in the bot's mainhand, not just somewhere in the hotbar. (2) Loop `world.mine_block` 30+ times against the same block to accumulate enough ticks to actually break basalt. (3) Use `world.place_block` with the new `side` param to build a horizontal escape — find any adjacent basalt face and click its UP/cardinal face to drop a placeable block in the air pocket; chain placements to stairstep upward. (4) If the bot has 12+ planks (Your-Items-Are-Safe insurance), walk it into a known lava block via repeated short-hop `baritone.goto`s — items survive at the death coords; bot respawns at overworld spawn for full RESUPPLY. Confirmed stuck pockets escaped 2026-04-19 via combinations of these tricks. |
| Bot pinned at y=1 in the nether bedrock layer (baritone refuses any goto, pillar_up RPC times out) | Bot fell into a 1x1x2 air pocket inside the y=0–4 bedrock band. Walls = bedrock (unbreakable). Floor = bedrock. Ceiling = air going up to y=3, but the only way to gain height is auto-place under feet — and the place target intersects the bot's own bbox, so vanilla MC cancels the placement. PillarUpTask's jump+use+pitch=90 trick fails for the same reason. | **Verified 2026-04-19 at (72, 1, 93) — this is essentially a one-way trap**. All of the following were tried and failed: `baritone.goto y=99` (refuses to path through bedrock), `baritone.command tunnel` (silent no-op), `baritone allowFly true` (no effect), `player.pillar_up` (timeout, can't place into own bbox), Meteor `flight` Velocity-mode + `player.press_key jump` (no velocity change in confined space; Vanilla mode rejected by server), Meteor `air-jump`/`high-jump`/`step` (require keyboard input + room), `world.place_block` of basalt at (72, 2, 93) — intersects bot bbox, refused, `chat.send /tp` and `/kill @s` (no op perms). Even the new `container.open_inventory` SWAP can't help here — the geometry is fundamentally unbreakable from inside the pocket. The bot starves over hours; recovery requires a server-side admin teleport OR letting MC run until food runs out + 1 HP per second of starvation = ~10 min of dying. **Prevention is the only fix**: add a y-floor return trigger at y < 30 to the MINE poll (baritone.mine follows basalt veins straight down past y=30 into the bedrock danger zone — STOP and pillar up before then). |

## Event monitors — surface bot state into the agent's context

The MINE poll loop is synchronous and only reports when `used`/`picks`/`hp`
flips. Four classes of events happen mid-cycle that the agent should see
in real time, NOT discover hours later from a log scan.

**Pickaxe (#3) and Inventory (#4) are the two MINE-phase return triggers
— they cause `baritone.stop` + return-to-portal. Flee (#1) and Death (#2)
do NOT trigger a return; they route through their own recovery paths.**

1. **Flee triggers** — `RunAwayFromDanger` decides the bot is in trouble
   and pathfinds away. If they pile up rapidly at the same coords, the
   bot is stuck in a danger zone and the agent should intervene
   (pillar out, change region) before HP runs out.
2. **Deaths** — `Bot was X by Y` in chat plus `Death Coordinates`. With
   "Your Items Are Safe" planks, knowing immediately means agent can
   send the bot back for recovery before items expire.
3. **Pickaxe count drop to 1** — **return-to-portal trigger.** When
   auto-replenish can't fill the hotbar any more, the bot is one break
   away from mining with fists. Agent must immediately `baritone.stop`
   and path to the nether portal — don't wait for the next /loop tick.
4. **Inventory full** — **return-to-portal trigger.** Free slots ≤ 2.
   baritone.mine still "runs" but every new drop despawns on the ground.
   Same response as low picks: stop mining, return to portal.

**Arm ALL FOUR at the start of every mining routine.** Flee + death
monitors tail the MC log; pickaxe + inventory monitors poll the HTTP
bridge. Each emits only on state transitions, not every tick. When an
alert arrives, the agent acts immediately — do not wait for a scheduled
/loop fire.

```

Why these specific filters:
- **Flee** — only fires on `Fleeing` lines. Anything else (config
  changes, info logs) gets dropped at the grep — keeps the noise down.
- **Death** — catches all four signals: cause-of-death message, death
  coords, items-safe-yes, items-safe-no. The last two are vital — they
  tell the agent whether to walk back for recovery (`safe`) or just
  re-gear (`not safe`).
- **Pickaxe** — tracks the last-seen count in shell state, emits only on
  transitions. Tags let the agent distinguish a pick break (`CRITICAL`/
  `LOW`) from a resupply (`REFILLED`) without inspecting the numbers.
- **Inventory** — same transition-only pattern; drops (`INV_DRAINED`) fire
  after a STORE deposit. Only `INV_FULL` / `INV_LOW` / `INV_DRAINED`
  emit — ordinary "+1 basalt" events are suppressed so the 13/min
  mining rate doesn't spam the chat.
  **False-positive caveat (2026-04-19):** `INV_DRAINED` also fires when
  `auto-replenish` moves a pick from main inventory to the hotbar after
  a hotbar-pick break. Net effect on `used`: -1 (the main-inv slot
  empties). Symptom: `INV_DRAINED used=N-1 (was used=N)` arriving paired
  with a `PICKAXE_CHANGE picks=K-1` event. Not a real STORE. A stricter
  filter would require the drop to be ≥5 slots to count as STORE. For
  now the paired `PICKAXE_CHANGE` disambiguates.
- Log monitors target `/tmp/portablemc.log` (launcher's nohup'd output).
  Bridge monitors target the HTTP RPC via the config file.

### Agent response table

| Event | Action |
|---|---|
| `Run Away From Danger] Fleeing` (single, HP > 12) | Log it. No action — benign. |
| `Fleeing` cluster (≥3 within 60s) OR any `Fleeing` while HP < 12 | Intervene. Peek at pos + HP, decide pillar-out vs. teleport-home. PushNotification the user. |
| `Bot was [killed] by [mob]` | Start death recovery. Read `Death Coordinates` from chat. Walk back within 5 min for items. |
| `Your items are safe` | Bot's planks absorbed the inventory loss. Re-gear via RESUPPLY; skip the death-coord walk. |
| `Your items are not safe` | Items are on the ground at death coords. Walk back within 5 min or accept the loss. |
| `PICKAXE_CRITICAL picks=1` | **`baritone.stop` → path to nether portal (goto 61,99,110) → traverse to overworld → STORE → RESUPPLY.** Do not wait for the /loop tick. |
| `PICKAXE_LOW picks=2` | Log it. Keep mining; next break puts us critical. |
| `PICKAXE_REFILLED picks=N` | Log it. Confirms RESUPPLY worked. |
| `INV_FULL free≤2` | **Same as PICKAXE_CRITICAL** — stop mining, path to portal, STORE. |
| `INV_LOW free≤5` | Log it. Consider wrapping up current mining pass. |
| `INV_DRAINED` | Log it. Confirms STORE worked. |
| `HOTBAR_SWORD_MISSING hotbar_count=0` | NOT a return trigger by itself, but the bot is now combat-blind: a sword in main inventory slots 9-35 doesn't count — auto-weapon can't see it. Action: open the nearest chest GUI (or any container) and SWAP the sword from main inv into hotbar slot 0. If no sword anywhere, treat the same as PICKAXE_CRITICAL and return to portal for full RESUPPLY (sword + planks). |
| `HOTBAR_SWORD_ACQUIRED hotbar_count=N` | Log it. Confirms a sword landed in the hotbar — combat is now functional. |

Do not `PushNotification` for routine single events (one flee, one
PICKAXE_LOW); DO push on compound situations (cascading flees + low HP,
death while far from recovery range).

## Telemetry pattern

When polling for long ops, only print on state CHANGES so notifications
don't spam:

```bash
LAST=""
while true; do
  CUR=$(rpc ... | jq ...)
  [ "$CUR" != "$LAST" ] && { echo "$CUR"; LAST=$CUR; }
  sleep 5
done
```

## Open TODOs / session notes

Things learned mid-run that deserve follow-up but aren't yet resolved. Append
as you hit new ones; prune as they get fixed.

- **2026-04-19 — diamond pickaxes exhausted at loot wall.** 31 chests scanned
  around (568, 66, 913); only stone pickaxes + diamond shovels remained in the
  tool chests. Need a source for new diamond picks: (a) mine diamonds + craft
  via a crafting table, (b) trade with villagers in the adjacent greenhouse
  (568 area has ~50 Armorers/Weaponsmiths), or (c) find a new loot chest in
  a different building. Until then, runs are short (stone-pick durability =
  131 blocks = ~1 hour of basalt mining across 5 picks).
- **2026-04-19 — `auto-replenish` + stone-pick rotation CONFIRMED WORKING.**
  Started with 5 stone picks; ~30 min later bot was at picks=2 and had 372
  basalt + 30 blackstone in inventory — meaning 3 picks shattered and the bot
  kept mining through each break without agent intervention. Per-pick yield
  was ~130 blocks, matching the stone-pick durability of 131 almost exactly.
  auto-replenish definitively moves spare picks from main inventory into the
  hotbar when the active one breaks.
- **2026-04-19 — mining rate with stone picks on basalt is ~13 items/min,
  not ~2.** Earlier estimate (based on a 3-min window just after dim flip) was
  wildly wrong; steady-state throughput on stone_pickaxe against basalt is
  ~13 blocks/min once the bot finds a vein. At that rate, filling inventory
  to 34 stacks is still unreachable within one run (stone picks last ~130
  blocks each, ~10 min per pick → 5 picks ≈ 50 min of mining ≈ 650 blocks ≈
  11 stacks). So `picks <= 1` remains the practical return trigger; the
  `used >= 34` trigger is a dead branch on stone-pick runs.
- **2026-04-19 — baritone.mine descended to y=16 following basalt veins.**
  Started at y=99 (portal level), ended at y=16 after ~30 min. Basalt pillars
  extend deep into the nether; baritone's mine algorithm follows them down
  without any y-floor guard. This is mostly fine (HP stayed >15), but the
  return-to-portal path now has to climb 83 blocks. Consider a y-floor check
  in the MINE poll: if `pos.y < 40`, stop and pillar up before the pick count
  hits the return threshold — keeps the trip-home shorter.
- **Nether portal pre-scan stuck.** `baritone.get_to_block nether_portal` from
  the overworld spawn area worked fine, but the `baritone.goto +8/+8` step
  intended to clear the portal in the nether went immediately idle without
  moving. Didn't block the run (baritone.mine itself handled pathing), but
  worth tracing — may be a goal-validation bug in mod-c's nether spawn
  handling.
- **Dim-flip timing.** The mine-routine's post-transit code waits for
  `dim == the_nether` and assumes baritone is ready immediately. In practice,
  baritone needed a `stop + reconfigure + re-fire` cycle to engage after
  transit. Consider adding a mandatory reset step to the skill's Step 1c,
  not as a fallback.
- **2026-04-19 — `baritone.goto` drops active=false mid-path periodically.**
  Not only after dim transits — also during pure overworld travel. Bot walked
  (478,71,834)→(520,66,871) then idle, retried goto → walked further, idle
  again, retried → final segment. Each retry (same coord) re-engages path
  planning. Workaround: don't exit the poll on the first `active=false`;
  either wait 3 consecutive idle polls before giving up, OR re-fire the same
  goto and continue polling. Probably a Baritone config around path-segment
  length — worth tracing and raising `pathCutoffDistance` or similar.
- **2026-04-19 — MINE poll loop can be replaced by Monitors.** The polling
  loop in Step 1d duplicates what the `PICKAXE_CRITICAL` and `INV_FULL`
  monitors now do. What remains is the SPOT_FILE maintenance (save last
  productive position on USED growth, delete on death). That's ~10 lines
  and could live inside a dedicated `spot-file` Monitor that polls every
  30s. Simplifying the loop would cut the skill by ~50 lines.
- **2026-04-19 — Death recovery walk is HIGH-RISK in the same area that
  killed the bot.** Bot died at (73, 57, 141) to magma cube. On recovery
  walk back, died AGAIN at (71, 57, 148) to a Wither Skeleton — same
  general region. Recovery created a SECOND items-safe stash at the new
  coords. Two stashes to recover from now. Lessons:
  (a) **Wooden sword is not enough** for deep nether (y<70). Wither
  skeletons one/two-shot a wooden-armed bot. Mandate iron+ sword on
  recovery walks.
  (b) The death zone often has SKELETONS + MAGMA CUBES + lava — bot needs
  full diamond/netherite armor + totem to survive.
  (c) Consider abandoning items if recovery cost exceeds replacement: a
  netherite pick is irreplaceable until we mine ancient_debris ourselves,
  but iron picks + golden carrots can be re-collected from chests.
  (d) Items DO persist at safe-stash coords across many cycles per the
  "Your Items Are Safe" mod — no rush. Better to come back well-geared.
- **2026-04-19 — Primary chest at (437, 68, 847) holds ~3 netherite_pickaxe
  + 4 iron_pickaxe + 9 stacks golden_carrot.** Coords.md snapshot from
  2026-04-18 said only stone_pickaxe + iron_shovel — current state has
  netherite picks, the rare pickaxe upgrade. Grab from here BEFORE the
  loot wall on RESUPPLY: netherite has 2031 durability vs iron 251 vs
  stone 131. Netherite picks should make a single mining run last 5-15× a
  stone-pick run — fewer return trips, less time outside the chest area.
